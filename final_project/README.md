### Final Project

This was the final project for the course.

The first step in the process was to analyze the scenario and draw UML diagrams to represent the classes, actors, etc. These diagrams 
were very useful as they gave a visual representation of the system, and helped with adding any necessary methods, objects, etc.

Then the diagrams were used to create the classes and methods. After this, the GUI was implemented using java programming

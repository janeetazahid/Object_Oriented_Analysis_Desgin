### Final Project

This was the final project for the course.

The first step in the process was to analyze the senario and draw UML diagrams to represent the classes, actors etc. These diagrams 
were very useful as they gave a visual representation of the system, and helped with adding any nesscary methods, object etc.

Then the diagrams were used to create the classes and methods. After this the GUI was implemnted using java programming.
